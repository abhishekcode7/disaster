# disaster
i am thinking to make an android application . 
for prediction:
 the app will use gps for location of user. once we know the location we can predict the disasters with max possibilities . like if we have an ocean nearby a tsunami has maximum possibility.
also google can be employed to predict chances of a tsunami by knowing history of tsunami at that place. also we can collect general data of wind speed , humidity, and other factors through a weather prediction site. if they are abrubt possible disaster can be predicted.
 
for prevention and management of impact :
google can be deployed to display preventions related to the predicted disasters . 
also we will send a notification message to all the contacts of the user through contacts in phone , facebook ,  instagram and also put a twitter post regarding the same.
through this we will be able to reach maximum number of people . those people who view this  post can furthur share the info and will be alert. in the same post made on social sites i will add a link to confirm the prediction of a disaster . if any person who sees the shared post thinks that the prediction is not true can downvote it and one who thinks it is correct can upvote it. the result of this poll will be updated on app and we can know the response of masses to the prediction.
